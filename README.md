# library.js
"We're also asking people to submit a quick code sample for us to review. We're after an ES5 Javascript class for a library which allows people to find book details by ISBN number and search for books by their title. Please add comments/thoughts about any limitations your implementations yours had and why you chose to do things a certain way. This shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes."
